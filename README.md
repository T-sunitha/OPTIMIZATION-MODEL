## RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
This project demonstrates how to use *Linear Programming (LP)* to
solve a real-world business problem using Python and the PuLP library.
The goal is to *maximize profit* by determining the optimal number of 
units of two products a factory should produce, subject to resource
constraints like machine time and labor hours.

## Task Description

Title: Product Mix Optimization Using Linear Programming in Python

Objective:
To solve a business decision-making problem involving optimal allocation of limited resources (machine hours and labor hours) for maximum profit. The task is to determine how many units of two products a factory should produce given constraints, using Linear Programming (LP).

## Technologies Used

Python 3-	Base programming language
PuLP-	Linear Programming modeling and solving
Matplotlib-	Visualization of feasible region and optimal solution
NumPy-	Numerical operations for plotting and constraint handling
Jupyter Notebook (optional)-	Interactive development and output display
