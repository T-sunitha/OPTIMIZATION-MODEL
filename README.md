## RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
This project demonstrates how to use *Linear Programming (LP)* to
solve a real-world business problem using Python and the PuLP library.
The goal is to *maximize profit* by determining the optimal number of 
units of two products a factory should produce, subject to resource
constraints like machine time and labor hours.
